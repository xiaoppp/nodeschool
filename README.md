Keep update!!!
-------

Run conditions:
-------
node version > 4.0

Code Style:
-------
Strictly follow airbnb javascript style(ES2015, JS6)
https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

In my opinion, you 'd better write all codes with the latest standard.

Note:
-------
Make sure you have delete all console.log when you run learnyounode verify, since it will disturb nodeschool to judge your program when contains other console.log...
